However, it will generally provide cover for any third parties who may be injured or killed in an accident involving your vehicle.",iselect,https://www.iselect.com.au/car-insurance/faqs/
What is compulsory third-party (CTP) car insurance?,"CTP insurance (or ‘green slip’ as it’s called in NSW) is compulsory third-party insurance. This can be included in the vehicle’s registration, depending in which state the vehicle is registered. It only covers claims for injury or death caused in an accident. It’s important to note that it doesn’t cover any costs related to third party damage, meaning that if you hit another vehicle, you are likely to foot the bill. However, a third-party property policy (the next level up in car insurance) could help cover some of these costs.",iselect,https://www.iselect.com.au/car-insurance/faqs/
What can comprehensive car insurance cover?,"Comprehensive car insurance is the highest level of car insurance cover. It can cover you for accidental damage to other people’s property and vehicles as well as damage to your own vehicle that’s caused by an accident, fire, or theft.",iselect,https://www.iselect.com.au/car-insurance/faqs/
What affects the price of car insurance?,"Car insurance is priced according to the risk the insurer is taking on. Factors like your age, driving record, home address and whether your car is parked in a garage or on the street can all affect the risk that the provider is taking and therefore, the cost of your car insurance premiums.",iselect,https://www.iselect.com.au/car-insurance/faqs/
What’s the cheapest car insurance?,"When it comes to car insurance, you get what you pay for. A very basic policy – like CTP – will be understandably cheaper than a comprehensive policy. Basically, the more a policy covers, the more it will cost. So for example, third-party property and theft generally costs more than third-party property, because it includes extra cover. While price is understandably important, there’s many things to consider. Such as what you definitely need cover for, and what you could go without to save you some cash. And keep in mind, a cheaper policy could end up costing you more when it comes time to make a claim.",iselect,https://www.iselect.com.au/car-insurance/faqs/
What’s the best car insurance?,"There’s no such thing as the ‘best’ car insurance. At iSelect, we can help you compare a range of different policies and providers to help you look for a suitable policy.",iselect,https://www.iselect.com.au/car-insurance/faqs/
What is a nominated driver?,"A nominated driver is a driver of your car that you have specified, or named, on your policy. If a driver is not listed on the policy, you will more than likely be subject to an additional excess, or you may not be covered in the event that you need to make a claim. Refer to your Product Disclosure Statement (PDS) to better understand the exclusions, limitations and excesses applicable in your policy.",iselect,https://www.iselect.com.au/car-insurance/faqs/
Which drivers must be listed on my policy?,"This will depend on your insurer, and what their rules are around who should be listed, but as a guide, you should have any regular drivers of your vehicle listed on your policy. If you’re unsure, review your policy documents and ask your insurer to see who needs to be listed on your policy.",iselect,https://www.iselect.com.au/car-insurance/faqs/
What’s the difference between agreed and market value of a car?,"With an agreed value insurance policy, the insurer and insured come to an agreement on what the payout value of the car is in the event of a write-off, or total loss, when a policy is taken out. With a market value policy, in the event of a total loss, the insurance company will work out the current market value of the car based on factors such as (but not limited to) the car’s condition, odometer reading, make, model and age which generally determines the payout figure. Agreed value policies are generally more expensive as you are able to set the value of the vehicle for the policy period. Market value insurance policies can be cheaper to take out as the value of the vehicle will be determined at the time of a claim. Remember that making a claim can lead to an increase in your premiums.",iselect,https://www.iselect.com.au/car-insurance/faqs/

What is comprehensive car insurance?,"Comprehensive car insurance provides the broadest range of cover. It can help cover repair or replacement costs for your car in an accident (even when you are at fault). While it’s generally more expensive than third-party property and third-party fire and theft, it could help you save money if your car is written off and needs replacing.",iselect,https://www.iselect.com.au/car-insurance/faqs/
What’s the difference between CTP and comprehensive insurance?,"It is important to remember these are two very different types of insurance. Compulsory third-party (CTP) car insurance is compulsory and covers any claims for injury or death caused as a result of your driving. It does not provide cover for any damage to other people’s property, or your own. So, if you hit a Ferrari when you only have CTP insurance, you’ll likely be liable to pay for those damages out of your own pocket. Ouch! Comprehensive car insurance does not cover injury or death, but it can help provide cover for damage to vehicles and property (either your own or someone else’s), up to the limits and conditions of the policy.",iselect,https://www.iselect.com.au/car-insurance/faqs/
Are there any exclusions with comprehensive cover?,"As with any insurance policy, there are exclusions with comprehensive car insurance. Some are obvious, such as illegal driving activities, licensing status issues, or unregistered vehicles. Others are more unexpected, like general wear and tear and breakdown, neither of which is generally covered. Also, failing to disclose any modifications to your vehicle can result in claims being denied. You may consider checking for full exclusions with individual providers before you take out a policy.",iselect,https://www.iselect.com.au/car-insurance/faqs/
What’s the difference between comprehensive and third-party car insurance?,"Third-party property car insurance covers only the damage caused to other people’s vehicles and property, while comprehensive car insurance can help cover your own vehicle and belongings as a result of an at fault claim.",iselect,https://www.iselect.com.au/car-insurance/faqs/

On the other hand, other insurers offer it as an optional extra. However, even if your policy covers windscreens, you may need to pay a basic excess to repair or replace it. This can also count against your claims history so be sure to check all your options.",iselect,https://www.iselect.com.au/car-insurance/faqs/
What happens if my car is a total loss?,"If you write your car off or it is stolen and not recovered, a comprehensive policy could pay you out the current market value of your vehicle.

If your licence is currently suspended, some insurers may insure your car, but you will not be covered to drive it until your licence is reinstated.

What happens when your car is written off by an insurance company?,"When you make a car insurance claim, your insurer will request quotes for the necessary repairs from one or more authorised repairers. If the repair costs come close to, or even outweigh, the insured value of the car, your insurer may decide to 'write off' your car instead of authorising the repairs. When a car is written off, its details are entered in the Written-Off Vehicle Register (provided it's less than 15 years old and weighs less than 4.5 tonnes). The insurer will then provide the owner with a payout or a replacement car, depending on your insurance policy. This may be a car of the same model, or the market or agreed value, depending on your level of cover. ANZ offers new vehicle replacement as standard on our Comprehensive Car Insurance, meaning that if your new vehicle is written off within the first 3 years of registration, you will be provided with a new vehicle of the same make, model, engine size and paint type, if available in Australia.",anz,https://www.anz.com.au/personal/insurance/car-insurance/
What do agreed value and market value mean?,"When you commence a car insurance policy that covers your vehicle (e.g. Comprehensive or Third Party Fire and Theft) you can typically choose between 'agreed value' or 'market value'.

The benefit is you know exactly what you're what you're covered for if your car is written off or stolen after an insured event. What is market value car insurance? If your policy is 'market value', your insurer will generally cover the reasonable replacement cost based on what your car's worth 'in the market'. This value is determined by your insurer at the time of claim by comparing your car to the market value of cars that are the same make, model, age, mileage and overall condition as yours.",anz,https://www.anz.com.au/personal/insurance/car-insurance/
Will my car insurance rates rise after a claim?,"Your car insurance premiums may increase after a claim, depending on your insurer and your situation. If you’re the at-fault party, it’s likely your premiums will increase. So, if you were to make multiple claims in a period, your insurer will see you as a greater risk to insure, which may result in higher premiums.Even if you’re not at fault, it is possible your premiums could increase. As such, it’s important you compare car insurance policies to find a level of cover that suits your driving history, budget and needs.",comparethemarket,https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/car-insurance/resources/

If you can, provide any photographic evidence and police reports to your insurer as well.Don’t forget to take photos of your vehicle and the other vehicle to present as evidence of damage to your provider when you claim.If the police attended the scene and documented your accident, your insurer will also use this to substantiate your claim (please record any police report details taken while the police were in attendance).Your insurer may also require a vehicle inspection to determine the damage. Throughout the claims process, your insurer will take care of communication between the other driver and their insurer if needed.Depending on your insurer, you may be able to track the progress of your claim online.

How do car insurance claims work?,"If you’re involved in an accident and a vehicle (either your own or someone else’s) sustains damage covered by your policy, you can make a car insurance claim immediately. Depending on your insurer, this can be done online or over the phone. Even if the accident wasn’t your fault, it’s important you still contact your insurer so they can deal with the other person’s insurance provider.When making a claim, you’re electing for your insurer to cover damages and losses. Your insurer will review your claim with the information and evidence you provide to support it. If your insurer accepts your claim, they’ll organise the repair or replacement of affected vehicles or property; this is known as the benefit or payout.To ensure you’re covered, it’s vital you’re honest with your insurer about your claims history or any modifications or damage your car may have. If you aren’t transparent with your insurer when signing up for your policy, there’s a chance your cover could be invalid or your claim rejected.When you’re at fault in an accident, you may be required to pay an excess. This is an amount you agree to pay in a claim when you take out or renew your policy.",comparethemarket,https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/car-insurance/resources/
How long should a car insurance claim take?,"It may only take a short time to initiate a claim with your insurer over the phone or online. However, the length of time it takes for your claim to be finalised depends on its circumstances.Your insurer will contact the other driver or their insurance company to gather more information to substantiate your claim. They will consider evidence from both parties, as well as any police reports to help determine who was at fault. On top of this, your insurer may request a vehicle inspection to ascertain the level of damage sustained from the crash.If either party were injured during the accident, your Compulsory Third Party insurer might also need to undertake medical examinations as well.Due to the extent of the damage and the communication with the other party, it’s difficult to say how quickly your claim will be fully processed. If all parties cooperate and communicate effectively, it could be a matter of days. If there’s any uncertainty or extra investigation required, it could take much longer.Once your claim is finalised, your insurer will take the appropriate action that suits your policy.",comparethemarket,https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/car-insurance/resources/
What does comprehensive car insurance cover?,"Comprehensive car insurance can provide cover for a range of scenarios and is the most extensive level of protection. It covers damages to both your car and others if you’re involved in an accident, regardless of who’s at fault. It will also insure your car against things like theft, storm and hail damage, vandalism and other things that befall your vehicle.While comprehensive insurance provides a wide level of protection for vehicles and property, it doesn’t cover your liability an accident occurs with your vehicle where another person is injured or killed. Only Compulsory Third Party (CTP; also known as Green Slip) insurance covers these scenarios and is a mandatory level of protection every registered vehicle in Australia must have.To learn more about comprehensive car insurance, read more about the different types of car insurance available in Australia.",comparethemarket,https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/car-insurance/resources/
Is it worth getting comprehensive car insurance?,"We think it’s worth taking out comprehensive car insurance, provided you can afford it. After all, you’ve spent thousands of dollars on your car – why not protect that investment?Whether you need a comprehensive policy will ultimately depend on your individual needs and budget. Keep in mind that comprehensive car insurance provides a top level of protection for your car; not only does it cover you for damage to your vehicle as well as damage to another person’s car and property, but it also covers the cost to replace your vehicle if it’s stolen or damaged or destroyed in a fire.Let’s say your car is left out the front of a friend’s house one afternoon after calling in for a visit and a storm hits and hail damages the exterior of your car. This could amount to several thousands of dollars’ worth of damage to be repaired. Could you handle such an out-of-pocket expense? This is where having a comprehensive insurance policy could save the day.To learn more about how car insurance could protect you in a range of scenarios, take a look at comprehensive car insurance.",comparethemarket,https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/car-insurance/resources/
I have comprehensive car insurance. Do I need CTP?,"Yes, every car on Australian roads must have Compulsory Third Party (CTP) insurance on their vehicle, otherwise known as Green Slip cover in New South Wales. In most states and territories, the cost of this cover is included in your annual registration fees, whereas in others, you can choose your CTP provider and take out insurance alongside your registration.CTP insurance covers death or injuries caused by the registered vehicle.Other policies, such as comprehensive cover, for example, are designed to cover the other things that CTP insurance doesn’t, like the repair or replacement costs of your car and a third party’s vehicle and property.",comparethemarket,https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/car-insurance/resources/
Can I buy six-month car insurance?,"Car insurance policies are typically 12-month agreements. However, if you only require car insurance for six months, you can always cancel your policy early.

Can I insure a car that has been written off?,"When a car is written off, it's entered into your state or territory’s written-off vehicle register. Once this happens, it’s typically difficult to get your car back on the road again. If your vehicle is deemed a statutory write-off (the car is too damaged to be repaired to road safety standards), you won’t be able to re-register and re-insure the vehicle at all, and its Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) will be recorded as a statutory write-off.If your vehicle is classified as a repairable write-off, however, you may be able to apply to your state or territory authority to re-register the vehicle if it’s repaired and passes both an authorised safety inspection and an inspection for written-off vehicles. You may then be able to re-insure it.",comparethemarket,https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/car-insurance/resources/
Can I get car insurance with a suspended licence?,"Yes, some insurers will still offer car insurance if you have a suspended license – however, this doesn’t mean you’ll be covered if you drive with a suspended licence. If you’re not allowed to drive for any reason and you still take to the road, you’ll be in breach of your policy terms and will not be covered if you make a claim.A license suspension may also drive up your excess or premiums, since a suspension or other driving disqualifications may indicate to your insurer that you’re a risky driver. You could still be able to get car insurance, but it will likely be more expensive as a result of your suspension.",comparethemarket,https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/car-insurance/resources/
Are older cars more expensive to insure?,"There are a variety of factors that can affect the cost of your car insurance premiums. Along with the make, model and condition of your vehicle (as well as your claims history), your insurer also considers your car's age when you take out a policy.

Can I get car insurance on the same day?,"Your car insurance is typically effective from the day you take out your policy, or whichever date you choose for your policy to start. However, your cover may be delayed if your insurer requires a vehicle inspection before you can take out your policy.Additionally, in some circumstances and some locations, insurers may place a restriction (or embargo) on new policies if they deem it necessary. For example, you may not have cover for storm or flood damage during a certain period of time if these events are forecasted or are happening in the area your car is in. These exceptional circumstances, however, are outlined on your Certificate of Insurance and Product Disclosure Statement (PDS), so make sure you read this when you take out your policy.",comparethemarket,https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/car-insurance/resources/
Can I insure a car I don’t own?,"Insurance is typically taken out by the owner of a car, so that there’s cover if the car is involved in an accident. You can also insure a car you don’t own if you have insurable interest in the vehicle – that is, if the car were damaged or stolen, you would suffer a financial loss. However, if you are driving a car insured in a friend’s name while they are away for any length of time, you may find that your insurer will void any claim you make in the event of an insured event.",comparethemarket,https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/car-insurance/resources/

At the very least, your excess payments and premiums could increase significantly.",comparethemarket,https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/car-insurance/resources/
Can you buy a car without insurance?,"Yes, you can purchase a car without insuring it with either of the third-party insurance products or comprehensive cover. However, your car will need Compulsory Third Party (CTP) insurance (or Green Slip cover in New South Wales) before you can drive it at all. CTP insurance provides a minimum level of protection to cover your legal liability if a third party is injured or killed in an accident, and it’s mandatory across Australia.How you get CTP insurance will depend on which state or territory you register it in; for example, in Queensland, it’s included in your registration fees.As CTP insurance doesn’t cover the damage costs to your car or property as well as other drivers’ cars and property, it’s important you consider an additional level of cover. Try our online comparison tool to find out which type of car insurance suits your needs and budget.",comparethemarket,https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/car-insurance/resources/
What do car insurance companies check when you take out their insurance?,"When taking out a car insurance policy, each insurer has their own set of questions they’ll ask to determine their risk in insuring you. They’ll typically require the following information:Your vehicle’s model, make and ageYour registration detailsAny anti-theft devices fitted to your carAny aftermarket modifications/fittingsHail or accident damageYour driving historyYour claims historyThe address of where your car is parked and whether it’s garaged or parked on the street.It’s vital that you’re transparent when applying for a policy.

As always, make sure you read and understand your policy’s Product Disclosure Statement (PDS), including the information your insurer requires, before you take out a policy.",comparethemarket,https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/car-insurance/resources/
Do I have to pay for my car insurance up front?,"If you decide to pay for your car insurance premiums annually, you will be required to pay for the full year upfront. This payment method may be cheaper for you in the long run, as you may dodge administration fees that are often added to direct debit monthly payments.For monthly payments, you will pay the first instalment within a couple of days of commencement, if not immediately.",comparethemarket,https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/car-insurance/resources/
Can I insure a hail-damaged car?,"Yes, you may be able to insure a hail-damaged car, but you are required to inform your insurer of this before taking out cover; otherwise, your cover may be void or future claims may be knocked back. You also won’t be covered for the existing hail damage to your car.You may also be limited in your choices for policies.

Does car insurance include GST?,"Yes, car insurance premiums include GST (Goods and Services Tax). You can see this amount outlined on your Certificate of Insurance.",comparethemarket,https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/car-insurance/resources/

However, you may still want to take out cover to protect your car against vandalism, fire or theft.You may also want to insure your vehicle if another driver regularly uses your car. In this case, you should list this driver on your policy, as you may have to pay an unlisted driver excess in the event of a claim if you don’t.",comparethemarket,https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/car-insurance/resources/
How can I insure a company car?,"When taking out insurance for a company car, it’s important you flag it as ‘private and business use’ or ‘business use’ on the policy. Using your car for business reasons typically means you’ll be travelling on the road more often compared to a car that’s used for private use and commuting to work. As such, your premiums may be slightly more expensive given your greater claims risk.When comparing car insurance with our comparison tool, we’ll also ask you other questions insurers need to know, like if your car will be used for:Ferrying passengers for paymentProviding paid driving instructionMaking deliveries or ridesharing servicesHiring your car out to other people.If you answer ‘yes’ to any of these questions, you may need to seek out specifically designed cover for business use, as standard consumer insurance may not provide protection for these activities.",comparethemarket,https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/car-insurance/resources/
How many drivers can be insured for a car?,"The number of drivers you can have listed on your car insurance policy depends on your insurance provider, so it’s best to contact them directly to find out if they have a limit.It’s important to note that drivers who use your car regularly should be listed on your insurance policy. If an unlisted driver is involved in an accident with your car, you could be hit with an unlisted driver excess on top of the standard excess. Your insurer could even refuse your claim.Additional drivers on your policy may attract a higher premium, especially if they’re under the age of 25 or are inexperienced. This can also impact the excess you’re required to pay if they’re found at-fault in an accident.If your vehicle is used for business purposes and any number of employees drive it, you may want to consider a specialised business car insurance policy.",comparethemarket,https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/car-insurance/resources/
Who should I complain to about car insurance companies?,"If you believe your insurer has not fulfilled their obligation to you, as outlined in your policy’s Certificate of Insurance and Product Disclosure Statement (PDS), you can lodge a dispute with your insurance provider. Beyond that, you have a right to escalate it through an independent governing body.In the first instance, it’s vital you contact your insurer to settle the issue. If you can’t come to an agreement with your insurer, you can contact the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA), an impartial, independent organisation that offers free dispute resolution services to customers having troubles with their insurer.Most reputable insurance companies are members of AFCA, and many are required by law to be members. It’s helpful to keep written records about your dispute for AFCA to settle issues between you and the insurer.AFCA cannot assist with Compulsory Third Party (CTP)/Green Slip disputes. You must contact your state authority instead.If you believe your claim was unfairly denied, here’s a guide on how to dispute a car insurance claim.",comparethemarket,https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/car-insurance/resources/
What happens if I let my car insurance lapse?,"If you let your car insurance policy lapse, you may not be covered in the event of a claim. If the claim occurred during the period of insurance, you can still lodge a claim even if the policy has expired.Whether you have Third Party Property and Damage, Third Party Fire and Theft or comprehensive car insurance, you will not be covered for any claims or incidents that occur after your car insurance has expired. This means you’ll be vulnerable to major out-of-pocket costs if you were to damage your car or another person’s vehicle (or property) in an accident.Your insurance provider will send you a notice prior to your policy expiring, informing you if they will offer a new term of insurance and the conditions of that offer. There is absolutely no obligation for an insurer to hold cover after the policy expires.However, if your car is still registered, Compulsory Third Party (CTP) insurance or Green Slip cover will remain in place, which covers your legal liability if your vehicle is responsible for injury or death in an accident. This cover is mandatory for all cars on Australian roads, and as such, you will not be able to drive on the road until you re-register your vehicle.When taking out car insurance again, it’s important that you choose a policy that meets your needs and budget.

Can car insurers refuse to pay?,"Car insurers can refuse to pay a claim if you don’t meet your policy conditions as outlined in your Product Disclosure Statement (PDS). Insurers can also refuse payment if you were misleading when you first took out a policy (e.g. you failed to disclose that your car is parked on the street at night, rather than a garage), or if you were driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol.Your claim may also be refused if:You didn’t pay your car insurance premiumsYou modified your car and didn’t tell your insurerYou didn’t properly maintain your car and it’s no longer roadworthyYou restricted drivers to a certain age (e.g. 25 or over) but an age-restricted driver drove your car and caused an accident.For the full list of reasons why you may be refused a claim, it’s vital you talk to your insurer and carefully read your PDS.",comparethemarket,https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/car-insurance/resources/
Do I need insurance to register my car?,"Yes, you must take out Compulsory Third Party (CTP) insurance (known as Green Slip cover in New South Wales, MAC in Northern Territory and MAI in ACT) when you register your car. CTP insurance is a mandatory level of cover for all registered vehicles in Australia. It covers your legal liability if your vehicle is involved in an accident and another person is injured or killed.In Australia, each state differs in how CTP or Green Slip insurance is applied to your vehicle:ACT: Motor Accident Insurance (MAI) must be purchased separate to registering or purchasing your vehicle. MAI will only cover personal injury to the impacted driver and any passengers. It will not cover damage caused to another vehicle or property.New South Wales: Green Slip insurance will cover you financially for the death, injury and damage your vehicle causes to other people.Northern Territory: Motor Accidents Compensation (MAC) acts as a no-fault scheme where all parties involved in an accident have a level of cover and can make a claim regardless of who was at fault.While you don’t have to take out any other type of car insurance, it’s likely to be in your best interest to do so, as you’ll get a much larger range of protection. For instance, if you were involved in a car accident where you were at fault, comprehensive car insurance would cover damages to the third party’s vehicle and property as well as your own vehicle’s damage.Learn more about other types of car insurance and why they’re worth considering on top of your CTP insurance.",comparethemarket,https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/car-insurance/resources/
What types of car insurance are there?,"There are four main types of car insurance cover available in Australia – three of which you can choose to take out as added protection for your car.Compulsory Third Party (CTP) insurance is mandatory cover all cars driven on Australian roads must have before taking to the roads. It’s designed to cover your legal liability if your vehicle is responsible for injury or death to another person on the roads.Third Party Property Damage (TPPD) covers you for the repair and replacement costs of damages you cause to a third party’s car and property. However, it doesn’t cover your car for damages, thefts, fires or other things.Third Party Fire and Theft (TPFT) not only provides the same level of cover as TPPD, but it also provides an extra level of cover for repair and replacement costs if your car is stolen or is damaged in a fire.Comprehensive cover provides the greatest level of car insurance you can take out. It covers the repair or replacement costs if your car is stolen, damaged by fire, theft, accidents or certain weather events. If you’re at fault for an accident, it will also cover the damage to another person’s vehicle or property.Read more about different types of car insurance to find out which one may suit your needs.

Compulsory Third Party (CTP) insurance is mandatory for every driver in all Australian states and territories.",comparethemarket,https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/car-insurance/resources/
"When I buy a new car, do I need insurance?","While you’re not legally obligated to take out additional levels of insurance on top of your CTP, it’s a smart idea to consider extra cover as soon as you make your purchase. These extra levels of cover can dramatically reduce your out-of-pocket damage and repair expenses.For instance, you can take out Third Party Property Damage insurance, which can cover the cost of damage you cause to another person’s car or property. Third Party Fire and Theft cover provides an extra level of protection if your car is stolen or damaged in a fire.Comprehensive car insurance offers a top level of protection against a range of scenarios, including damage caused to your vehicle and property, as well as another person’s vehicle and property.If you need insurance for your new car, compare car cover today.",comparethemarket,https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/car-insurance/resources/
When do you pay excess for car insurance?,"Excess is the amount you agree to pay to your insurer if you’re at fault in an accident. Your excess is payable when you claim on your policy, and your insurer may deduct this excess from your payout amount, or you may have to pay it out upfront.Let’s say you’re the at-fault driver in an accident and cause $10,000 in damage. If you agreed to pay a $600 excess when making a claim, your insurer will typically foot the remaining $9,400 to cover the repair costs.As always, check your Certificate of Insurance to be sure of the amount and types of excesses you’ve agreed to pay in the event of a claim. Also, read your Product Disclosure Statement (PDS) to find out when you may need to pay the excess or if you have any additional excesses that you may need to pay.",comparethemarket,https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/car-insurance/resources/

Depending on your car’s make and features, it may be categorised as a veteran, vintage, prestige or (for certain US imported vehicles) an American classic car. Aside from ensuring the best protection for your valuable asset, insurance for your classic car is well worth it when you consider the expenses that come with repairing such a vehicle, like sourcing international replacement parts and specialised repairs.",comparethemarket,https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/car-insurance/resources/
What happens if my car insurance is cancelled?,"If you or your insurer cancels your cover, your vehicle is no longer protected by that policy.Before you consider seeking out new cover, make sure you call up your old insurer and find out why the policy was cancelled in the first place.If you drive without a suitable level of cover, you could risk out-of-pocket expenses if you damage your car or another person’s car or property. It’s also best if you don’t delay in taking out a suitable level of cover, as your car could be stolen or vandalised when not in use.Be sure to compare car insurance to find suitable cover before you take to the roads.",comparethemarket,https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/car-insurance/resources/
How does gap insurance work after a car is totalled?,"Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP) insurance protects you against financial loss if your car is under finance and written off in the first couple of years of your ownership.GAP insurance is particularly useful in the first few years of your finance contract, where your car’s insured value typically depreciates faster than what you can pay it back (which will include interest). This means your car will be worth less than what you owe on your loan.If your car is written off while under finance, you may still need to pay out the remainder of your debt. The amount your insurer compensates you for (i.e. your car’s insured value) may not be enough to cover the amount you still owe on your car (known as a shortfall).Say you owe $25,000 in finance on your car, but it’s worth (and is insured for) $20,000 at the time it’s written off; GAP insurance can cover the $5,000 in difference between what you still owe your financier and what you received as compensation from your insurer.",comparethemarket,https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/car-insurance/resources/
How do insurance companies total a car?,"Each Australian state and territory has its own laws that outline when a vehicle should be written off. However, in general, insurance companies will total a car if they determine the cost to repair the damage will outweigh your vehicle’s current worth or what it’s insured for. This is known as a repairable write-off.If your vehicle is considered unsafe to repair, your insurer will list it as a statutory write-off or a non-repairable write-off. These types of vehicles can never be repaired, re-registered or re-insured. These options usually wind up at the scrapyard, stripped of their valuable parts and turned to scrap metal.",comparethemarket,https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/car-insurance/resources/
Why do my car insurance premiums go up the longer I stay with an insurer?,"There are a range of factors that may cause an increase in your car insurance premiums, even if you’ve been with your insurer for a longer period. Some of these increases may result from:A change in personal circumstances (e.g. new address, place of work)InflationA change in government taxesAn increase in natural weather eventsAn increased chance you’ll make a claim.Your insurer will reassess your likelihood to claim, which may increase the amount you pay monthly or annually. For example, if you’ve been involved in an accident or your area has received an influx in claims due to a natural disaster, you are a greater risk to your insurer. As such, your insurer will adjust your premiums to reflect your likelihood to claim.While it may be tempting to hide certain information from your insurer, like an accident or speeding fine, you do have a duty to not make a misrepresentation. As such, if you aren’t transparent with your insurer, they may knock back future claims or cancel your cover.So, what can you do to combat increasing premiums?It’s crucial you’re aware of other policies on the market that could offer better value for your needs and budget.

Is motorbike insurance cheaper than car insurance?,"The cost of motorbike insurance compared to car insurance depends on a range of variables. While some motorbike insurance policies can be expensive (as some insurers believe motorbikes pose a higher risk on the road), every driver and their vehicle is unique.For instance, the cost of both motorbike and car insurance is based on factors like driver age and vehicle make, model and modifications. Premiums are also calculated against the driver’s experience, claims history and the location the vehicle is parked (among other factors). As such, some motorcycles may attract higher policy premiums than some car models and vice versa.Just like a car, all vehicles including motorbikes on Australian roads must have Compulsory Third Party (CTP) insurance to protect your legal liability on the roads.",comparethemarket,https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/car-insurance/resources/
Does the colour of my car affect my premiums?,"Your vehicle’s colour may impact your premiums depending on the type of paint used, such as a flat paint or metallic finish.For example, if you drive a car with flat paint, you won’t necessarily have higher premiums on your insurance. However, if it’s a metallic paint, you may face increased premiums, as unique colours can be harder to source or repair should it be damaged.Curious about other factors that could impact your premiums?

How can I bring my car insurance premiums down?,"There are a few ways you can reduce the cost of your car insurance premiums. Firstly, and depending on your situation, you could restrict young drivers from using your car. By doing this, insurers may consider the policy to be less risky, and the premium may be reduced as a result.You can also increase the amount of excess you pay when you make a claim – many insurers will lower your premiums in exchange for this. Just be aware that this increased excess is what you’ll pay if you need to claim, so make sure it’s an affordable amount. As such, it’s important you carefully consider your finances and if the additional excess is really worth it.Also, if you don’t drive great distances (e.g. less than 15,000 kilometres each year), you may be eligible for a low-kilometre product which could reduce your premiums. If you work from home or commute to work via public transport, it could be worth talking to your insurer to see if you qualify for this type of policy.Keen to learn more about how you could save on your car insurance?

Market value is the amount your vehicle is worth on the open market right before the claimed incident. As part of the claims process, QBE (our insurance provider) will determine the market value of your car using recognised industry guides.

If you or anyone driving your car causes an accident in which someone else is injured, CTP covers their medical costs and compensation they are entitled to.
CTP doesn’t cover damage to your car or the responsibility of the driver of your car for damage caused to other people’s vehicles or property.",AustralianPost,https://auspost.com.au/help-and-support/answers?c=ComIns100
What’s the difference between comprehensive and third party car insurance?,"Third party car insurance offers an essential level of protection.

What is the Pay As You Drive option?,"Pay As You Drive is unique a concept in car insurance. Designed specifically for cars that are driven 15,000km per year or less, it offers all the benefits of Comprehensive insurance, but you only pay for the kilometres you plan to drive. Here's a summary of how it works:
When you buy a Pay As You Drive policy, you nominate the number of kilometres you plan to drive each year (up to 15,000km) and tell us your car’s odometer reading at the start of the policy. We add these together to calculate your End Odometer reading, which will be shown on your Certificate of Insurance.
We calculate your premium based in part on the number of kilometres you tell us you plan to drive.
At the time of a claim, if your car's odometer reading at the time of the incident is more than your Start Odometer reading and less than the End Odometer reading shown of your Certificate of Insurance, you get the same cover as you would with our Comprehensive insurance. If not, you still have the same cover, except you also pay the Outside Odometer excess ($1000). This is in addition to any other excesses which apply to the claim. In some cases, no excess is payable.
At each renewal, we increase your End Odometer reading by the number of kilometres you told us you planned to drive each year. You can also ask us to adjust your End Odometer reading at any time. However, your end odometer reading cannot be more than 15,000km higher than: your Start Odometer reading (for new policies); or
your End Odometer reading immediately before your last renewal (for renewed policies).
To increase your End Odometer reading, give us a call on 13 13 43.
