The loading will increase up to a maximum of 70% and will only be removed after 10 years of continuous private hospital cover. This means if you sign up at the age of 40, you'll pay an extra 20% for Hospital cover, compared to someone who joined at age 31.You can avoid paying the additional LHC by taking out AAMI hospital cover by 1 July following your 31st birthday. As long as you keep your private hospital cover, you can avoid paying the 2% annual loading. The loading only applies to the hospital component of your premiums and does not apply to Extras cover or Ambulance only cover.Learn more about hospital cover",

Basically, the more a policy covers, the more it will cost. So for example, third-party property and theft generally costs more than third-party property, because it includes extra cover.

With a market value policy, in the event of a total loss, the insurance company will work out the current market value of the car based on factors such as (but not limited to) the car\u2019s condition, odometer reading, make, model and age which generally determines the payout figure. Agreed value policies are generally more expensive as you are able to set the value of the vehicle for the policy period.

It does not provide cover for any damage to other people\u2019s property, or your own.

If the repair costs come close to, or even outweigh, the insured value of the car, your insurer may decide to 'write off' your car instead of authorising the repairs. When a car is written off, its details are entered in the Written-Off Vehicle Register (provided it's less than 15 years old and weighs less than 4.5 tonnes). The insurer will then provide the owner with a payout or a replacement car, depending on your insurance policy. This may be a car of the same model, or the market or agreed value, depending on your level of cover. ANZ offers new vehicle replacement as standard on our Comprehensive Car Insurance, meaning that if your new vehicle is written off within the first 3 years of registration, you will be provided with a new vehicle of the same make, model, engine size and paint type, if available in Australia.",

This will determine how your payout is calculated if your car is written off or stolen. What is agreed value car insurance? If your car insurance covers you for 'agreed value', you'll generally be covered for an amount that you and your insurer agree to insure your car for \u2013 regardless of the age or market value of your car at the time of the insurance claim. The benefit is you know exactly what you're what you're covered for if your car is written off or stolen after an insured event. What is market value car insurance? If your policy is 'market value', your insurer will generally cover the reasonable replacement cost based on what your car's worth 'in the market'. This value is determined by your insurer at the time of claim by comparing your car to the market value of cars that are the same make, model, age, mileage and overall condition as yours.",

You may choose to do this over the phone or, depending on your insurer, you can go online to begin your claims process.Be sure to provide as much information to your insurer as possible, including:The details of any other person involved in the accident. These include their name, licence number and contact detailsIf applicable, the details of the other driver\u2019s car or property (e.g. their registration number and their car\u2019s make, model and colour);The other driver\u2019s insurance detailsAny witnesses\u2019 contact details (they may be able to help substantiate your claim)A detailed account of the accident, including the date, time and nature of the damage. If you can, provide any photographic evidence and police reports to your insurer as well.Don\u2019t forget to take photos of your vehicle and the other vehicle to present as evidence of damage to your provider when you claim.If the police attended the scene and documented your accident, your insurer will also use this to substantiate your claim (please record any police report details taken while the police were in attendance).Your insurer may also require a vehicle inspection to determine the damage. Throughout the claims process, your insurer will take care of communication between the other driver and their insurer if needed.Depending on your insurer, you may be able to track the progress of your claim online.

    "question": "How do car insurance claims work?",
    "answer": "If you\u2019re involved in an accident and a vehicle (either your own or someone else\u2019s) sustains damage covered by your policy, you can make a car insurance claim immediately. Depending on your insurer, this can be done online or over the phone. Even if the accident wasn\u2019t your fault, it\u2019s important you still contact your insurer so they can deal with the other person\u2019s insurance provider.When making a claim, you\u2019re electing for your insurer to cover damages and losses. Your insurer will review your claim with the information and evidence you provide to support it. If your insurer accepts your claim, they\u2019ll organise the repair or replacement of affected vehicles or property; this is known as the benefit or payout.To ensure you\u2019re covered, it\u2019s vital you\u2019re honest with your insurer about your claims history or any modifications or damage your car may have. If you aren\u2019t transparent with your insurer when signing up for your policy, there\u2019s a chance your cover could be invalid or your claim rejected.When you\u2019re at fault in an accident, you may be required to pay an excess.

    "question": "How long should a car insurance claim take?",
    "answer": "It may only take a short time to initiate a claim with your insurer over the phone or online. However, the length of time it takes for your claim to be finalised depends on its circumstances.Your insurer will contact the other driver or their insurance company to gather more information to substantiate your claim. They will consider evidence from both parties, as well as any police reports to help determine who was at fault. On top of this, your insurer may request a vehicle inspection to ascertain the level of damage sustained from the crash.If either party were injured during the accident, your Compulsory Third Party insurer might also need to undertake medical examinations as well.Due to the extent of the damage and the communication with the other party, it\u2019s difficult to say how quickly your claim will be fully processed. If all parties cooperate and communicate effectively, it could be a matter of days. If there\u2019s any uncertainty or extra investigation required, it could take much longer.Once your claim is finalised, your insurer will take the appropriate action that suits your policy.",

    "question": "What does comprehensive car insurance cover?",
    "answer": "Comprehensive car insurance can provide cover for a range of scenarios and is the most extensive level of protection. It covers damages to both your car and others if you\u2019re involved in an accident, regardless of who\u2019s at fault. It will also insure your car against things like theft, storm and hail damage, vandalism and other things that befall your vehicle.While comprehensive insurance provides a wide level of protection for vehicles and property, it doesn\u2019t cover your liability an accident occurs with your vehicle where another person is injured or killed. Only Compulsory Third Party (CTP; also known as Green Slip) insurance covers these scenarios and is a mandatory level of protection every registered vehicle in Australia must have.To learn more about comprehensive car insurance, read more about the different types of car insurance available in Australia.",

    "question": "Do I need insurance to register my car?",
    "answer": "Yes, you must take out Compulsory Third Party (CTP) insurance (known as Green Slip cover in New South Wales, MAC in Northern Territory and MAI in ACT) when you register your car. CTP insurance is a mandatory level of cover for all registered vehicles in Australia. It covers your legal liability if your vehicle is involved in an accident and another person is injured or killed.In Australia, each state differs in how CTP or Green Slip insurance is applied to your vehicle:ACT: Motor Accident Insurance (MAI) must be purchased separate to registering or purchasing your vehicle. MAI will only cover personal injury to the impacted driver and any passengers. It will not cover damage caused to another vehicle or property.New South Wales: Green Slip insurance will cover you financially for the death, injury and damage your vehicle causes to other people.Northern Territory: Motor Accidents Compensation (MAC) acts as a no-fault scheme where all parties involved in an accident have a level of cover and can make a claim regardless of who was at fault.While you don\u2019t have to take out any other type of car insurance, it\u2019s likely to be in your best interest to do so, as you\u2019ll get a much larger range of protection.

    "answer": "If a vehicle is more than 25 years old or has \u2018historical value\u2019, it can be considered a classic car. Depending on your car\u2019s make and features, it may be categorised as a veteran, vintage, prestige or (for certain US imported vehicles) an American classic car. Aside from ensuring the best protection for your valuable asset, insurance for your classic car is well worth it when you consider the expenses that come with repairing such a vehicle, like sourcing international replacement parts and specialised repairs.",

    "question": "How does gap insurance work after a car is totalled?",
    "answer": "Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP) insurance protects you against financial loss if your car is under finance and written off in the first couple of years of your ownership.GAP insurance is particularly useful in the first few years of your finance contract, where your car\u2019s insured value typically depreciates faster than what you can pay it back (which will include interest). This means your car will be worth less than what you owe on your loan.If your car is written off while under finance, you may still need to pay out the remainder of your debt. The amount your insurer compensates you for (i.e. your car\u2019s insured value) may not be enough to cover the amount you still owe on your car (known as a shortfall).Say you owe $25,000 in finance on your car, but it\u2019s worth (and is insured for) $20,000 at the time it\u2019s written off; GAP insurance can cover the $5,000 in difference between what you still owe your financier and what you received as compensation from your insurer.",

However, in general, insurance companies will total a car if they determine the cost to repair the damage will outweigh your vehicle\u2019s current worth or what it\u2019s insured for. This is known as a repairable write-off.If your vehicle is considered unsafe to repair, your insurer will list it as a statutory write-off or a non-repairable write-off. These types of vehicles can never be repaired, re-registered or re-insured. These options usually wind up at the scrapyard, stripped of their valuable parts and turned to scrap metal.",

    "question": "Why do my car insurance premiums go up the longer I stay with an insurer?",
    "answer": "There are a range of factors that may cause an increase in your car insurance premiums, even if you\u2019ve been with your insurer for a longer period. Some of these increases may result from:A change in personal circumstances (e.g. new address, place of work)InflationA change in government taxesAn increase in natural weather eventsAn increased chance you\u2019ll make a claim.Your insurer will reassess your likelihood to claim, which may increase the amount you pay monthly or annually. For example, if you\u2019ve been involved in an accident or your area has received an influx in claims due to a natural disaster, you are a greater risk to your insurer. As such, your insurer will adjust your premiums to reflect your likelihood to claim.While it may be tempting to hide certain information from your insurer, like an accident or speeding fine, you do have a duty to not make a misrepresentation. As such, if you aren\u2019t transparent with your insurer, they may knock back future claims or cancel your cover.So, what can you do to combat increasing premiums?It\u2019s crucial you\u2019re aware of other policies on the market that could offer better value for your needs and budget.

While some motorbike insurance policies can be expensive (as some insurers believe motorbikes pose a higher risk on the road), every driver and their vehicle is unique.For instance, the cost of both motorbike and car insurance is based on factors like driver age and vehicle make, model and modifications. Premiums are also calculated against the driver\u2019s experience, claims history and the location the vehicle is parked (among other factors). As such, some motorcycles may attract higher policy premiums than some car models and vice versa.Just like a car, all vehicles including motorbikes on Australian roads must have Compulsory Third Party (CTP) insurance to protect your legal liability on the roads.",

    "answer": "There are a few ways you can reduce the cost of your car insurance premiums. Firstly, and depending on your situation, you could restrict young drivers from using your car. By doing this, insurers may consider the policy to be less risky, and the premium may be reduced as a result.You can also increase the amount of excess you pay when you make a claim \u2013 many insurers will lower your premiums in exchange for this. Just be aware that this increased excess is what you\u2019ll pay if you need to claim, so make sure it\u2019s an affordable amount. As such, it\u2019s important you carefully consider your finances and if the additional excess is really worth it.Also, if you don\u2019t drive great distances (e.g. less than 15,000 kilometres each year), you may be eligible for a low-kilometre product which could reduce your premiums. If you work from home or commute to work via public transport, it could be worth talking to your insurer to see if you qualify for this type of policy.Keen to learn more about how you could save on your car insurance?

Comprehensive Car Insurance covers your car, plus damage you cause to other people\u2019s cars or property.

    "question": "What is the Pay As You Drive option?",
    "answer": "Pay As You Drive is unique a concept in car insurance. Designed specifically for cars that are driven 15,000km per year or less, it offers all the benefits of Comprehensive insurance, but you only pay for the kilometres you plan to drive. Here's a summary of how it works:\nWhen you buy a Pay As You Drive policy, you nominate the number of kilometres you plan to drive each year (up to 15,000km) and tell us your car’s odometer reading at the start of the policy. We add these together to calculate your End Odometer reading, which will be shown on your Certificate of Insurance.\nWe calculate your premium based in part on the number of kilometres you tell us you plan to drive.\nAt the time of a claim, if your car's odometer reading at the time of the incident is more than your Start Odometer reading and less than the End Odometer reading shown of your Certificate of Insurance, you get the same cover as you would with our Comprehensive insurance. If not, you still have the same cover, except you also pay the Outside Odometer excess ($1000). This is in addition to any other excesses which apply to the claim. In some cases, no excess is payable.\nAt each renewal, we increase your End Odometer reading by the number of kilometres you told us you planned to drive each year. You can also ask us to adjust your End Odometer reading at any time. However, your end odometer reading cannot be more than 15,000km higher than: your Start Odometer reading (for new policies); or\nyour End Odometer reading immediately before your last renewal (for renewed policies).\nTo increase your End Odometer reading, give us a call on 13 13 43.\nSee our Product Disclosure Statement for more details.",
