# üöó FAQ Bot - Your Car Insurance Chatbot

Welcome to the FAQ Bot! This is a simple chatbot designed to help you with questions about car insurance in Australia. It uses a collection of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and OpenAI's technology to provide you with helpful answers.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Smart Matching**: The bot understands your questions and finds the best answers from its FAQ database.
- **Dynamic Responses**: If it can't find an exact match, it will create a helpful answer based on similar questions.
- **User-Friendly**: Just type your question, and the bot will respond instantly!

## üìã What You Need to Get Started

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Git**: Version control software to manage your code. You can download it from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **Python**: Version 3.7 or higher installed on your computer. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **OpenAI API Key**: You'll need an API key from OpenAI to use the chatbot. You can sign up for one [here](https://platform.openai.com/signup).

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows) and run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Andreymae/faq-bot.git
cd faq-bot
```

If you don't have Git installed, you can download the project as a ZIP file from [this link](https://github.com/Andreymae/faq-bot/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Virtual Environment

Setting up a virtual environment is a good practice to keep your project organized. It creates a separate space for your project dependencies.

**For Mac/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**For Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

You should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command line, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Required Packages

With your virtual environment activated, install the necessary packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will download all the libraries bot needs to function.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Your OpenAI API Key

The bot needs an OpenAI API key to work properly. Set it as an environment variable.

**For Mac/Linux:**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

**For Windows:**
```bash
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

Make sure to replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual API key from OpenAI.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Bot

Now, let's start the bot! Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

You should see messages indicating that the server is running.
